# Concepts

## Grants 

Grants gives open source projects of all sizes the opportunity to seek and receive community funding.

## Grant Rounds 

Grant Rounds are collections of Grants (projects looking for funding) in a given period of time (e.g. quarterly for Gitcoin Grant Rounds). On top of the amount these projects will raise individually from their Contributors, there is also a Matching Pool for each Grant Round which matches funding based on the Quadratic Funding model. You can find more information [here on Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com/). 

The current version only allows for the dgrants core team to create Grant Rounds, but not community members yet. Look forward to this in future updates! 

## Grant Owners, Funders and Contributors 

Grant Owners are the team behind the Grants which are building projects that the Web3 community find meaningful.

> If you're a Grant Owner, head to our [Grant Owners' Guide](/docs/grant-owners-guide/create-edit-grants) for tutorials and more. 

When putting up a Grant, funding for Grant Owners can come from 2 sources - Contributors and Funders. 

Contributors are donors and patrons who want to support and fund a particular project submitted by a Grant Owner. 

> If you're a Contributor, head to our [Contributors' Guide]((/docs/contributors-guide/add-to-cart-checkout)) for tutorials and more. 

Funders are donors and patrons who do not fund a particular project, but fund a Grant Round which will be distributed to different projects based on their respective donations and support. If this sounds like you, you can go to this link 

> If you're a Funder, head to our [Funders' Guide](/docs/funders-guide/fund-grant-round) for tutorials and more. 


## Cart 

Similar to the shopping cart in e-commerce, The Cart is where you can add all the Grants you are interested in supporting.

## Check Out 

Once you have confirmed all the Grants you'd like to support, you can check out the Cart. Once the transaction is successfully confirmed, the funds will be contributed and ready for the Grant Owners to claim once it is over.
