# Concepts

## Grants 

A Grant is an open source public goods project that has the opportunity to receive community funding and user traction.

## Grant Rounds 

Grant Rounds are collections of Grants (projects looking for funding and traction) in a given period of time (e.g. quarterly, for Gitcoin Grant Rounds). On top of the individual amount these projects raise from their Contributors, there is also a Matching Pool for each Grant Round which matches funding based on the Quadratic Funding model. You can find more information [here](https://wtfisqf.com/) on Quadratic Funding. 

The current version only allows the Decentralized Grants core team to create Grant Rounds. We will open this functionality to the community in future updates! 

## Grant Owners, Funders and Contributors 

Grant Owners are the team behind the Grants which are building projects that the Web3 community find meaningful.

> If you're a Grant Owner, head to our [Grant Owners' Guide](/docs/grant-owners-guide/create-edit-grants) for tutorials and more. 

When putting up a Grant, funding for Grant Owners can come from 2 sources - Contributors and Funders. 

Contributors are donors and patrons who want to support and fund a particular project submitted by a Grant Owner. 

> If you're a Contributor, head to our [Contributors' Guide]((/docs/contributors-guide/add-to-cart-checkout)) for tutorials and more. 

Funders are donors and patrons who do not fund a particular project, but fund a Grant Round which will be distributed to different projects based on their respective donations and support. If this sounds like you, you can go to this link 

> If you're a Funder, head to our [Funders' Guide](/docs/funders-guide/fund-grant-round) for tutorials and more. 

A Grant Owner is the owner of a open source public goods project that the web3.0 community finds useful. When putting up a Grant, they are looking for Grant Contributors, who are supporters who would like to contribute funds to open source public goods.

## Cart 

Similar to the shopping cart in common ecommerce platforms, the Cart is where you can add all the Grants you are interested in supporting.

## Checking Out 

Once you have confirmed all the Grants you would like to support, you can checkout the Cart. Once the transaction is successfully confirmed, the funds are used in the Quadratic Funding calculation and are claimable by the Grant Owners once the round is over.
