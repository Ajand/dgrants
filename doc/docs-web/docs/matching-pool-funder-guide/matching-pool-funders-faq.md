# FAQ

> What does it mean if I add funds to a Grant Round? 

Adding funds to a grant round essentially means you're adding to the matching pool for that grant round. Remember, the matching pool is the amount awarded to each grant on top of the individual amount grants raise from contributors. The way these matching pool funds are distributed is dependent on the quadratic funding mechanism.

> Why would I want to add funds to a Grant Round?

Similar to being a contributor to a grant, being a matching pool donor still means you're meaningfully contributed to grants, just to an entire round as dictated by the mechanism. This usually means matching pool donors are contributed in the tens of thousands of dollars (and possibly more)!
