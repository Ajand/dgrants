# FAQ

> Why would I open a Gitcoin Grant here instead of on gitcoin.co?

Here in the Ethereum space, we don't want a governing body making decisions about which grants to approve, how much funding a grant gets, how those funds get disbursed, and handling dispute resolution. In accordance to distributing more and more power to our community, a decentralized grants protocol was naturally the path that we're moving towards. Consider yourself a extremely early adopter if you're reading this!

> I don't see my Gitcoin Grant after submitting my application. Where is it?

This is a new feature that hasn't been released yet! For now, grants are manually approved by the dGrants team.

> I've found a bug and/or something isn't working when opening my grant.

Please open a ticket on the [dGrants repository](https://github.com/dcgtc/dgrants/issues/new/choose)!
