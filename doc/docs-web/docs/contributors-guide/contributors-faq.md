# FAQ

> What is a grant?

A grant is an open source public goods project that has the opportunity to receive community funding and find user traction.

> What is a grant round? Does that differ from a matching round?

Grant rounds are collections of grants that are subject to additional funding through a matching pool for a given period of time (e.g. quarterly for Gitcoin Grant Rounds). They are not any different from a "matching round". On top of the individual amount these projects raise from contributors, there is also a portion of the grant round matching pool that is awarded to each grant based on a quadratic fudning model. You can find more information [here](https://wtfisqf.com/) on quadratic funding. 

> What is the quadratic funding match and why is it so powerful for public goods?

The way grants work is that individuals make contributions to public good projects of value to them. The amount received by the project is proportional to the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received minus the actual contributions themselves. Math aside, the concept here is that a greater portion of the matching pool is awarded to projects with many more smaller contributions (e.g 100 contributions of $5) than to grants with few, very large contributions (e.g 2 contributions of $1000). The reason for this is that quadratic funding helps to amplify the signal of coordination reverses the tragedy of the commons.
